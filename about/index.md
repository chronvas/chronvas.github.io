## Short bio
I am an Android developer and the past year I am developing Android applications, using mostly Java on Android Studio but also having a little experience developing with C# on Xamarin for Visual studio. I am currently learning about technologies and practices that make developing with Java and Android easier, more structured, easily scalable and producing better quality code.
I have also worked with ASP .NET and MVC5 creating simple web applications.

I am a jack of many trades, I have a strong background on IT, computer hardware and networks with many years of experience, I am a graduate of Technological and Educational Institute of Thessaly, Department of Computer Science and Telecommunications (CST), and I also enjoy getting my hands on technologies involving sensors, micro-controllers and small electronics like Arduino and embedded systems like Raspberry Pi, building small projects for the purpose of discovering the IOT world and gaining experience at working with Linux.

I am a part of a team of developers and a co-founder Figata, a startup emerging from the 1st Startup Weekend Larisa as the 1st place winners.
